#Spreadsheets

Most of us are familiar with spreadsheets, rows of data, with each column in a row having a different piece of data that relate to each other somehow.

A database is an application that can store data, and we can think of Google Sheets as one such application.

For example, we created a Google Form to ask students their favorite TV show and genre of it. We look thorugh the responses, and see that the spreadsheet has three columns: “Timestamp”, “title”, and “genres”:

We can download a CSV file from the spreadsheet with “File > Download”, upload it to our IDE, and see that it’s a text file with comma-separated values matching the spreadsheet’s data.
