# Introduction to Git

In this lab you will learn:
-What Git is
-What GitHub is
-How to set up a 'local' Git repositroy
-How to push changes from your local machine to the cloud

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

Imagine a situation where you are writing an essay, and you decide to make some changes.  After reading the changes, you realize the essay just isn't going in the direction you want, and would like to go back to the version you had before you made the changes.  You realize that you saved your new version with the same name, and have lost your original version ---- OH NO!

This is where Git comes in.  Git is a tool that tracks version history.  You have a master timeline, and can create branches off of that timeline.  You can keep the changes on separate branches, or if you decide you like the changes, you can "merge" the changes back to the master timeline.
