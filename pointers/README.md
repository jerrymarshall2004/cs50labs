# Pointers

In this lab you will learn:

- What a pointer is
- How to allocate and free memory

## What is a Pointer?
The address of a variable is called a pointer, which we can think of as a value that “points” to a location in memory. The * operator lets us “go to” the location that a pointer is pointing to.
